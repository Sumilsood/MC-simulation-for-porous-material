The block diagram of the both spectral and diffuse reflections is given on the next page. This system considers the parameters of emissivity (solid absorptivity), refractive index, spectral or diffuse reflection of the particles. The parameters of bed length or dimensions, diameter, porosity will be accounted in the packing model of the porous bed. These algorithms will be run for different values of dimensions, diameter, different size spheres and porosity to get data on all these parameters for training the NN model.
